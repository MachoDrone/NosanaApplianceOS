- **AI Infrastructure**: On-demand access to computational power for AI projects

## Possible Explanations for the 0.4 SOL Deduction

### 1. GPU Rental Costs

- **Payment**: While the native token is NOS, SOL may be used for certain transactions or as collateral

### 2. Platform Fees
- **Service Fees**: Nosana may charge platform fees for using their infrastructure
- **Transaction Fees**: Beyond standard Solana network fees, there may be additional platform-specific charges
- **Conversion Fees**: If converting between SOL and NOS tokens

### 3. Staking-Related Activities
- **Staking Deposits**: Required SOL for staking operations
- **Unstaking Penalties**: Potential fees when unstaking tokens before the completion period
- **Validator Fees**: Costs associated with validator node operations

### 4. Smart Contract Interactions
- **Contract Execution**: Complex smart contract interactions may require higher gas fees
- **Compute Units**: Solana charges based on compute units consumed, and AI-related transactions can be resource-intensive
- **Priority Fees**: Additional fees to ensure transaction processing

## Nosana's Business Model
