# Proxy Configuration UI Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The proxy configuration screen in the semi-automated installer was displaying dark text instead of a proper UI widget for the mirror test results. The user could see the proxy input field normally, but the test results area was missing the proper UI formatting.

## Root Cause
The autoinstall mode was interfering with the normal UI rendering of the proxy configuration screen. Even with `proxy` in the `interactive-sections`, the autoinstall framework was affecting how the mirror test results were displayed.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Autoinstall Configuration
**Previous:**
```yaml
proxy: null
```

**Fixed:**
```yaml
proxy: ~
apt:
  disable_components: []
  preserve_sources_list: true
```

### 2. Enhanced GRUB Configuration
**Previous:**
```
linux /casper/vmlinuz autoinstall ds=nocloud-net;s=/cdrom/server/
```

**Fixed:**
```
linux /casper/vmlinuz autoinstall ds=nocloud;s=file:///cdrom/server/ console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8
```

### 3. Apt Configuration Prevention
Added explicit apt configuration to prevent autoinstall from interfering with the natural mirror/proxy testing process:
- `disable_components: []` - Don't disable any components
- `preserve_sources_list: true` - Keep original sources.list

## Files Created
1. `autoinstall-user-data-fixed` - Fixed autoinstall configuration
2. `grub-autoinstall-fixed.cfg` - Fixed GRUB configuration
3. `remaster-standalone-fixed.py` - Complete fixed standalone script

## How to Use the Fix
Use the fixed standalone script:
```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MachoDrone/NosanaApplianceOS/refs/heads/cursor/create-customizable-auto-installer-options-e879/remaster/remaster-standalone-fixed.py | python3 - -autoinstall
```

## Expected Result
The proxy configuration screen should now display:
- ✅ Normal proxy input field
- ✅ Proper UI widget for mirror test results (instead of dark text)
- ✅ Interactive mirror connectivity testing
- ✅ Location-based mirror auto-suggestion when field is left blank

## Technical Details
The fix works by:
1. Using `proxy: ~` instead of `proxy: null` for cleaner YAML parsing
2. Explicitly preserving the sources.list to prevent autoinstall apt interference
3. Adding console parameters to improve UI rendering
4. Preventing autoinstall from pre-configuring anything related to apt/mirrors

This ensures the proxy configuration screen runs in full interactive mode with proper UI rendering while still maintaining the autoinstall functionality for the forced choices (SSH disabled, minimal server, no snaps).
